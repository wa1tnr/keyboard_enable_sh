The script in this directory does 'work' but is
overly global (set and forget):

```
    97-lenovo-USB-trackpad.conf
```

Wanted dynamic control of if/when the TrackPad
section of the keyboard is active.

Elsewhere in this git repository is the current
iteration of the work, leveraging xinput.

END.
